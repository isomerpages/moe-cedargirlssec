Every year, Cedar Girls' PSG plays an active role in the school's calendar of events. Here's what we do:  
  
**Participate in school events** such as Induction Ceremony, Speech Day, Sports Day, National Day celebration and Teachers' Day celebration.  
  
**Organise various activities** such as parent-child bonding sessions, fun family outings, parent-get-together sessions and parenting workshops.  
  
**Join the Parent Befriender-Scholar Programme** where international scholars in the school are paired with a parent befriender and Cedarian to help them adapt to life in Singapore.  
  
**Organise the annual Youth Day Carnival** which is a fun-filled day for our daughters to celebrate, unwind and enjoy an array of games and food with their friends.
