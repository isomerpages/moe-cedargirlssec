<p><strong>Is there a broader range of Cut-Off Point (COP) for DSA students? If I am applying for DSA Sports, will my child's results for P5 and P6 (SA1) be one of the criteria?</strong>
</p>
<p>DSA students do not need to meet the school's PSLE COP for admission.
However, students need to qualify for the Express course in order to join
Cedar Girls’. This means that they would need to have an AL score of between
4 and 22.</p>
<p>The indicative AL score for Cedar Girls’ is between 4 - 9 for the O-Level
Programme and 4 - 8 for the Integrated Programme. When choosing a secondary
school, parents are advised to take into consideration the pace and rigour
of learning at the school and ensure that it is suitable for their child.
Students' P5 and P6 results are taken into consideration during shortlisting.</p>

<p><strong>How many vacancies are open for each DSA category? How many applications do you get on average for each category?</strong>
</p>
<p>The number of DSA vacancies offered by schools varies from year to year
based on projected school enrolment and also the school's assessment of
applicants. We seek your understanding that we are unable to share this
data. Based on data for the previous two years, we received more than 300
DSA applications each year.</p>

<p><strong>If my daughter is given a place in the Integrated Programme (IP) for DSA, will she be switched to the O-Level Programme if she has not done well for her PSLE?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be offered either IP or the O-level Programme at the point
of the confirmed offer. The school will honour the confirmed offer after
the selection exercise. Hence, if the student’s PSLE AL score does not
meet the school's Cut-Off Point (COP) for IP, the student will still be
allowed to stay in IP. However, the student would need to meet the Express
course COP which is 22.</p>

<p><strong>Is it possible to switch from the O-Level Programme to the Integrated Programme if a student meets the cut-off point for the Integrated Programme but was offered the O-Level Programme for DSA?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students may appeal for a transfer when the posting results are out provided
that their PSLE AL score meets the cut-off point. The application can only
be considered if the school has a vacancy. Students are advised to honour
the programme that they have committed to when they accepted the confirmed
offer.</p>

<p><strong>Are DSA students allocated to one class or will they be placed in different classes? Would they be given extra academic support (if need be) to catch up on studies in view of the additional time spent on training and competitions?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students admitted via DSA will be allocated into a class just like any
student who is admitted via the Secondary 1 central posting exercise. There
is no class dedicated to DSA students. We provide all necessary support
to help our students to flourish, regardless of their mode of admission.
Most of our DSA students have done well and have comparable performance
to our non-DSA students.</p>

due to valid medical reasons, the possibility of allowing a change of CCA
could be considered.</p>

<p><strong>What is the selection criteria for the Talent Development Programme for Social Innovation?</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s DSA-Social Innovation programme is looking for P6 students
who have a love for community work and a passion to innovate through exploration
and experimentation. On top of these qualities, they should espouse the
value of empathy. Students who are not part of the DSA programme can still
aspire to be part of the Talent Development Programme in Year 3 should
they exhibit the disposition for it.</p>

<p><strong>Does one need to be a student leader for DSA-Social Innovation (DSA-SI)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Holding a leadership position in primary school is not a core criteria
for DSA-SI. There is also no leadership position in DSA-SI as it is not
a CCA.</p>
<p>However, being a primary school student leader would mean having experience
serving the school community or having opportunities to participate in
service learning or VIA projects. Thus, such students should have the skill
sets to lead and influence others to come up with solutions to address
community needs which is key to Cedar Girls’ SI Programme.</p>

<p><strong>My daughter is very shy. How will she be able to make friends and be comfortable?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my daughter is having trouble making friends who care about her?</strong>
</p>
<p>Year 1 starts with an orientation programme to help students make new
friends and understand how secondary school works. Year 2 and Year 3 student
leaders assigned to the Year 1 classes orientate the new students to the
new environment and develop bonds and friendships through hands-on activities
and games. In addition, each Year 1 student will have a senior as her buddy
throughout the year.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and Digital
Literacy programmes equip the students with knowledge and skills for smooth
transitioning to secondary school. To further support the well-being of
all our students, including our Year 1s, opportunities have also been created
to allow form teachers to get to know their students individually through
dialogue sessions.</p>

<p>Students are strongly encouraged to participate in only one school-based

</p>
<p>There are four main CCA categories: Clubs and Societies, Physical Sports,
Uniformed Groups, Visual and Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Each CCA develops different skill sets and caters for both talent development
and broadening of learning experiences. Students without prior experience
in a CCA may be allocated the CCA if she has indicated a strong interest
for the CCA. However due to resource constraint, each CCA can only take
in a limited number of students. Students are strongly encouraged to keep
an open mind when selecting CCAs. They are strongly encouraged to attend
some of the hands-on practice sessions conducted before CCA Selection Day,
and avoid selecting from only one CCA category.</p>

<p>Yes, students are allowed to choose any CCA that is offered in Cedar Girls’.
In the CCA selection process, students will be given a number of choices
to indicate their areas of interest. The allocation of CCA depends on the
