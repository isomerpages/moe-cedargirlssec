<p><strong><u>Important Points to Note<br></u></strong>Parents and students
are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes
and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements,
and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once your child has been given a confirmed offer, a place has been reserved
for your child in the school. However, your child must achieve a PSLE score
that qualifies them for Posting Group 3 in order for them to be allocated
to Cedar Girls’. You may wish to visit <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">go.gov.sg/posting-groups</a> for
more information on Posting Groups.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please take note that once your child is successfully allocated to our
school through the DSA-Sec, they will not be allowed to participate in
the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting to opt for secondary schools. They will also <u>not</u> be
allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school and programme (4 years for the
Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate Programme or 6 years
for the Integrated Programme) and participate in the activities related
to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.</p>
