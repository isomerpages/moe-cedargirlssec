Cedar Girls' Secondary School was founded in 1957 as a single-session girls' school with an enrolment of 507 pupils.
Amidst the uncertainties of the 1950s, and with the belief that education is the key to a secured future, it has since progressed from its humble beginnings to become one of the best schools in Singapore, well-known for its excellent achievements both in academic as well as in athletic fields.

Today, the school has a total enrolment of 1300 pupils.
