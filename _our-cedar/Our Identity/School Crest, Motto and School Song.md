### School Crest, Motto and School Song

##### Our Crest

<img src="/images/logo.png" style="width:240px;height:240px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Gold symbolizes the excellence that the school as a whole strives for and grey, the balance of mind and heart needed in the strive for excellence. Together, the two colours combine to reflect the spirit of Cedar Girls— brilliant but balanced. Blue and green, which denote the natural colours of our environment, symbolize the external world that Cedar Girls will prepare the students for.

A book engraved right at the top of the badge is a symbol of knowledge

and the academic excellence, which the school as a community is

committed to. A sturdy Cedar tree with its roots symbolizes the adult that Cedar Girls seeks to nurture — an adult who is steadfast in character, strong in their sense of belonging to the school and country, and gracious in their nature, like the fragrant Cedar.

##### Motto  
_Honesty, Perseverance, Courtesy_
