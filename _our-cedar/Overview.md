Cedar Girls' Secondary School was founded in 1957 with an enrolment of 507 pupils.

Amidst the uncertainties of the 1950s, and with the belief that education is the key to a secure future, it has since progressed from its humble beginnings to become one of the best schools in Singapore, well-known for its excellent achievements both in academic as well as in athletic fields.

&nbsp;Today, the school has a total enrolment of 1200 pupils.

#### Women of Character and Wisdom

Pupils are the focus of all that we do in Cedar as our vision is to nurture Cedarians into Women of Character and Wisdom who serve with Honesty, Perseverance and Courtesy. We do this by providing an enriching and exciting school environment so that pupils can build their character through a wide range of experiences and opportunities. All teachers have strong conviction that character development is of utmost importance. As such, all our programmes and systems support the various student outcomes of leaders of character, empathetic social innovators, all-rounded individuals and passionate learners. We work closely with various stakeholders to review our school programmes regularly to ensure that they bring about the desired impact on the pupils.

_Leaders of Character:_ Cedar has a whole-school values-education approach to Character Education. In our mission to develop Leaders of Character, we have a holistic character and citizenship development programme which inculcates the values, attributes and competencies desired of Cedarians. School values and virtues are cultivated in the cognitive, emotional and behavioural dimensions of character education. Curriculum time set aside for such lessons allows values to be taught and a whole range of support structures in school allows such values to be internalized and translated into everyday actions.

_Empathetic Social Innovators_: Pupils are empowered and given ownership, and are involved in the various aspects of school. For example, CCA leaders initiate Values in Action (VIA) projects, taking charge of the implementation and evaluation of the service learning projects for VIA. Student leaders are involved in working with the school management and the general pupil population in organising various school events and forums. These various experiences and opportunities support the development of well-balanced, ethical and secure young women who are poised to scale greater heights.

_All-rounded Individuals_: Pupils are given various opportunities to learn skills and develop social and emotional competencies through participation in various platforms. They develop strong bonds, responsibility, teamwork, independence and confidence. There is also a clear pupil leadership structure that provides for leadership training and recognition of efforts and achievements.

_Passionate Learners_: Effective teaching and learning helps our pupils to do well. Our teachers have good teaching strategies to promote learning and project work as well as to stretch pupils' learning. Pupils become well-versed and informed users of technology through blended learning and digital literacy lessons. Using active participation and collaboration with peers and even external organisations, our pupils continue growing as they work well with others.

#### Bringing Out the Best in Every Cedarian

Going back to fundamentals provides the building blocks to bring out the best in our pupils. We expect all Cedarians to be well-disciplined in conduct. There is a multi-prong approach in citizenship and character education as well as a good support system to build resilience in our pupils. Teachers hold dialogue sessions with pupils to understand more about each pupil and to help them in specific ways. Besides discipline, the school also emphasizes courtesy, perseverance and honesty. These values support a culture of excellence and every Cedarian tries her best in academia and co-curricular activities.

It is the school's quality programmes and nurturing environment that 'Brings out the Best in Every Cedarian'. These have contributed to the sustained success of Cedar Girls' Secondary School.
