### Overview

The Co-Curriculum plays an important role in the provision of holistic education to students. Our Co-Curricular Programmes aim to bring out the best in every student to nurture them into women of character and wisdom. Through our Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), students discover and strengthen their interests and talents, develop their exemplary character, learn moral values, and also develop non-academic qualities such as leadership, teamwork, zeal and empathy in human endeavour.

  

The CCAs offered in Cedar Girls can be classified into the following categories:

• Sports and Games

• Uniformed Groups

• Performing Arts

• Clubs and Societies
