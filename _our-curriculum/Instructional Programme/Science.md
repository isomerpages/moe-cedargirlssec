<p><strong>Department Vision:</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Our vision is to inspire an innovative learning environment where students
are empowered to explore, create, and seek solutions to real-world problems.
Moving beyond content knowledge, we foster a culture of curiosity and critical
thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our teachers, as a collaborative team across the disciplines of Biology,
Chemistry, and Physics, guide students in applying scientific concepts
to address local and global challenges. We strive to cultivate scientifically
literate individuals who are equipped to make informed decisions and contribute
responsibly to the future of Singapore and the world.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching and Learning Approaches:</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Our teaching and learning approach foster critical, adaptive and inventive
thinking skills through a multi-modality framework. This is achieved by:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Inquiry-Based Learning:<br></strong>Students engage actively in
their learning by posing questions, forming hypotheses, and refining their
ideas through experiments and observations. This approach not only nurtures
curiosity but also deepens their conceptual understanding, cultivating
an appreciation for the scientific method.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Context-Based Problem Solving:<br></strong>Science becomes relevant
when students apply their knowledge to discuss and address real-world challenges.
Our curriculum is designed to challenge students to think critically and
apply scientific concepts to novel situations. This enhances their problem-solving
abilities and prepares them for learning beyond the classroom.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Learning:<br></strong>Learning is a shared journey
of building knowledge. Students work closely with their peers, exchanging
ideas and building on each other’s insights. Through discussions with peers,
facilitated by teachers, they co-construct knowledge, strengthening their
scientific reasoning and communication skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Discussion of Socio-scientific Issues:<br></strong>Science shapes
our world. By exploring current global issues such as climate change, renewable
energy, and medical advancements, students critically assess the benefits
and consequences of scientific progress. The group-based discussions and
class presentations will heighten the awareness for responsible and ethical
thinking about science’s impact in Singapore and in the world.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Science Cohort Learning Journey</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every year, the department organises learning journeys for specific cohorts
of students. This allows students to further build their curiosity in the
subject and appreciate the application of scientific concepts in our daily
life.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Singapore Junior Science Olympiads (Biology, Chemistry, Physics)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To stretch the potential of our high ability science students, we provide
them with the opportunity to participate in the Singapore Junior Chemistry,
Biology, and Physics Olympiads. Through these competitions, students will
explore concepts beyond the school syllabus, sharpen their problem-solving
skills, and apply their knowledge to tackle challenging scientific problems.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Singapore Youth STEM Fair (SYSF)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For our lower secondary students who are passionate about science, they
have the exciting opportunity to participate in the Singapore Youth STEM
Fair (SYSF), a national competition promoting inquiry, innovation, and
problem-solving in STEM. Evolving from the Singapore Youth Science Fair,
it encourages students to explore real-world challenges through investigative
research and prototyping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>National STEM Championship (NSC)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The National STEM Championship (NSC) challenges Year 3 students to apply
scientific knowledge and problem-solving skills in real-world contexts.
Through interdisciplinary STEM challenges, they develop innovation, critical
thinking, and teamwork while tackling complex global issues. Participation
nurtures resilience and prepares them for future STEM pursuits.</p>
