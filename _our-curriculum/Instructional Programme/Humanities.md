<p><strong>Inquiry-Based Learning Approach:</strong><br>
Inquiry-based learning is at the core of the Humanities department's teaching
philosophy. This approach is designed to foster the development of confident
and critical thinkers by encouraging students to explore, question, and
analyze various topics within the Humanities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Developing Key Skills:</strong><br>
The department focuses on helping students ask meaningful questions, enabling
them to dive deeper into the subject matter and better understand the complexities
of different issues. Students are also guided to scaffold their learning,
allowing them to build upon foundational knowledge as they form their own
conclusions and develop personal reflections about a wide range of Humanities
topics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Multiple Perspectives for a Complex World:</strong><br>
The Humanities Department strives to provide students with a multitude
of lenses—such as cultural, historical, and social viewpoints—that can
help them better comprehend and make sense of the increasingly complex
world they live in. By broadening their perspectives, students are better
equipped to navigate real-world issues and challenges from a variety of
angles, fostering both critical thinking and global awareness.</p>

<p><strong><u>Humanities Enrichment</u></strong><br>
To allow our students to extend and deepen their learning in the Humanities,
students with the passion and interest are identified to participate in
a range of Humanities enrichments and competitions. These enrichment opportunities
are curated to allow students to understand the real-world applications
to their knowledge in the classroom.</p>

<p>Humanities Fieldwork</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our students, as part of their curriculum, get to explore sites around
Singapore as part of the department’s focus on authentic learning through
exploration and inquiry. This hones our students’ inventive thinking as
they learn to take on roles of different stakeholders and generate solutions
to authentic tasks, such as whether Pulau Ubin can be made into a tourism
site.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Competitions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students with a passion for the Humanities are given opportunities to
participate in various competitions, such as Historical Scene Investigation,
Student Archivist Project and Geography Challenge) with support by teachers
from the Department. These competitions stretch the students and develop
important competencies such as communication and information skills, as
well as their critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>ASEAN Studies Programme&nbsp;</u></strong><br>
As part of the development of our students’ civic, global and cross-cultural
literacy, students are given the opportunity to learn more about the region
and appreciate Singapore’s role and place in Southeast Asia. This is nurtured
through our four-year programme, where they are exposed to cultural workshops
associated with the art forms of the region to overseas learning journey
to Malacca where they are given the chance to engage with on-site learning
overseas and engage with their peers from the region.</p>
