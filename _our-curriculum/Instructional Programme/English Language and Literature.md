<p><strong>Teaching and Learning Approaches:</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Cedar’s English department adopts a <strong>structured curriculum</strong> that
progressively develops language skills and literary concepts over the students'
four years at the school. The curriculum emphasizes age-appropriate macro
concepts and themes, which help students apply foundational language and
literary skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students engage in <strong>authentic tasks set in real-world contexts</strong>,
taking on the role of practitioners, which enriches their learning experience.
They are also given opportunities to explore and express their personal
perspectives on global and local issues, fostering a sense of identity
and purpose.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The curriculum follows a <strong>social constructivist approach</strong>,
prioritizing collaborative and discovery learning to inspire a love for
learning. Recognizing that language is a skill-based subject, active learning
pedagogies are used to enhance student engagement and make thinking visible.
Teachers employ techniques like Socratic questioning to deepen students'
critical thinking.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Differentiated Instruction</strong> is used to cater to the diverse
needs of students. To prepare them for the future, ICT is integrated into
the curriculum through the Google Suite for Education and other Web 2.0
resources. Students are also taught to responsibly use Artificial Intelligence
tools to enhance their learning.</p>

<p><strong>Key Programmes:</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>1. Literature Fest (“Lit Up!”)</strong>
</p>
<p>Literature Fest is a week-long school-wide event that aims to nurture
a love for Literature in every Cedarian. Students develop an appreciation
for literary texts and characters through varied platforms such as creative
student representations of texts, meet-the-author sessions, roundtable
discussions, film screenings and interactive displays.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. Literature Enrichment</strong>
</p>
<p>Enrichment programmes are organised to broaden our students’ appreciation
of Literature through making connections from literary texts to self, other
texts, other readers and the world around them. These programmes include
learning journeys to theatre performances and creative writing workshops.</p>
<p>In 2024, Year 2 students participated in spoken word workshops as part
of the school’s Beyond Classroom Learning Week. In addition, Year 3 and
4 students attended a performance-lecture on Shakespeare’s Merchant of
Venice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Talent Development Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>Students keen on pursuing their interest in Literature and the English
language at a more advanced level can apply for research and creative writing
opportunities through the school’s Talent Development Programme.</p>
