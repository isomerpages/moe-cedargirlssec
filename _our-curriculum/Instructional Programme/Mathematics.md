<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mathematics is very important as it permeates every aspect of our daily
lives. Our differentiated approach strives to maximise the potential of
every student in the subject. Problem Solving is the central theme of our
Integrated Mathematics Programme. The pentagon framework shows the underlying
principles of the Integrated Mathematics Programme. It sets the direction
for the teaching, learning and assessment of Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching and Learning Approach</p>
<p>Mathematics is an excellent vehicle for the development and improvement
of a person’s intellectual competence in logical reasoning, spatial visualisation,
analysis and abstract thought. Pupils need to recognise and appreciate
the links between various components of Mathematics, the relationship between
Mathematics and other disciplines, as well as the relevance and importance
of Mathematics in real life situations.
<br>
<br>The Cedar Mathematics education provides learning opportunities and platforms
for pupils to acquire and apply creative thinking and problem solving skills
in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real
world problems. These authentic learning experiences will enable our pupils
to meet the challenges of the 21st century successfully where critical
and creative thinking skills are highly valued.

<h4>Programmes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1. The Level 3 Maths Learning Journey seeks to allow students to apply
Maths concepts in a fun and meaningful way in real world contexts. It also
allows students to appreciate the relevance of Maths in daily life and
the inter-connectedness of various subject disciplines.

<p><strong>2. Maths Talent Development Programme</strong> 
<br>
<br>Central to the Mathematics Talent Development Programme is the Mathematics
Olympiad Programme which seeks to develop the problem-solving skills of
those students who are passionate in Mathematics. These students undergo
a structured training programme and take part in the Singapore Mathematics
Olympiad (SMO) to hone their problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Students also gets a chance to take part in the International Mathematical
Modelling Challenge (IMMC), which aims to promote the learning of mathematical
modeling and applications for the students. It is based on the firm belief
that students need to experience the power of Mathematics to help better
understand, analyse and solve real world problems outside of Mathematics
itself, in realistic contexts. This is a true team competition, held over
a number of days with students able to use any inanimate resources and
a mix of different kinds of Mathematics for their analysis and solution
to real problems.
<br>
</p>
<p>The Research Programme aims to develop students’ intellectual capabilities,
subject-related interests, knowledge and skills necessary for the workplace
of the future. Students who are involved in the Maths Research projects
are also mentored for the Singapore Maths Project Festival.

<h4><strong>Assessment</strong></h4>
<p>In Cedar, the assessment principles are based on the belief that assessment
is used as a feedback mechanism to address learning gaps in pupils so that
pupils can adjust their learning tactics, and for teachers to consider
their intervention strategies. The Mathematics Department uses both pen
and paper and alternative modes of assessment. Pen and paper assessments
include class tests and examinations. Alternative modes of assessments
include formative assessments such as performance tasks and graded assignments.</p>
