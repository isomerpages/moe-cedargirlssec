<p>
We believe that the Science Programme at Cedar should consist of an enriched, current and appropriately challenging curriculum facilitated by knowledgeable and skilful teachers. <br><br>

  

The curriculum focuses on acquiring deep understanding of a substantive body of science conceptual knowledge, developing skills in scientific inquiry through investigations and through scientific thinking, creative problem-solving and developing 21st Century Skills. The science curriculum has major thrusts of science literacy as well as science talent development.<br><br>

  

To cater to the high-ability learners in science, opportunities for talent development is an integral aspect of their science education. Our Science education comprises deep understanding of science conceptual knowledge, practice in science process skills and acquiring the dispositions of a good scientist.<br><br>

  

Science has relevance beyond the classroom. Students should appreciate the role of science in everyday life and in solving technological, environmental and social problems, and the importance of the ethical implications of scientific advances.
