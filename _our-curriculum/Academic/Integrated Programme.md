<div>

<p>
The Victoria-Cedar Alliance is made up of three schools, Victoria School, Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) and Victoria Junior College (VJC). Since 2012, we have offered the 6-year Integrated Programme (IP) to boys and girls, where they spend 4 years in their respective secondary schools before moving to VJC for two years before attempting the GCE ‘A’ Levels. <br>

Bonded by a shared belief to prepare our students for the 21st century, we nurture our students to their full potential and develop every student to be a Social Innovator, Passionate Learner. Today the partnership extends to CCA collaborations, student leadership development and talent development to ensure that our students benefit from the alliance.<br><br>

We warmly welcome you to embark on this exciting 6-year journey with us.<br><br>

<p>
<b><i>Social Innovators, Passionate Learners</i></b><br><br>

  

The VCA IP curriculum is future-oriented and it encourages students to respect ideas, pursue excellence and celebrate discoveries. The VCA IP demands students’ full participation so that individuals may develop their personal voice and identity and stretch their potential.<br><br>

  

The VCA IP expects students to take strong ownership of their learning and to seek and create opportunities for their education so that, in the process, students may develop a passion for knowledge and equip themselves with the essential skills and intellectual habits of a lifelong learner.<br><br>

  

Education at the VCA IP empowers students to challenge and to lead. The VCA IP requires students to assume responsibility for personal actions and to exercise intellectual and moral courage. The scholarship and collegiality it fosters in its students should lead them, in their later lives, to promote understanding between people and to strive for the betterment of their country and the world.

<label for="accordion3">Imagineering Programme</label>

<div>

<p>
A signature programme of the VCA IP, the Imagineering Programme aims to nurture social innovators. It is the main platform through which students’ innovative capacity is developed and honed to provide them with the vital skills they need to create breakthrough solutions to real problems in a fast-changing world.<br><br>

  

Using Design Thinking as the approach, the Imagineering Programme helps students gain a deeper understanding of social issues and develop empathy and a desire to impact the community positively. It equips them with the skills and knowledge so that they can design innovative solutions to improve the lives of others.<br><br>

  

<i>Years 1 & 2</i><br>

Students develop basic skills and attributes in Design Thinking and apply them to classroom-based and school-based issues.<br><br>

  

<i>Years 3 & 4</i><br>

Working in partnership with Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and South-East Community Development Council (South-East CDC), students deepen their mastery of Design Thinking tools through engagement with real issues in society. In Year 4, students are encouraged to work on their own Social Innovation project.<br><br>

  

<i>Years 5 & 6</i><br>

Students further hone their Design Thinking skills and knowledge by serving as peer leaders during Project Work lessons. Students are encouraged to initiate Values-in-Action projects to benefit the community around them.
