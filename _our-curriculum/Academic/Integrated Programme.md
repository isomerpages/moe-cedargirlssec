<p>&nbsp; The Victoria-Cedar Alliance</p>
<p>The Victoria-Cedar Alliance is made up of three schools, Victoria School,
Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) and Victoria Junior College (VJC).
Since 2012, we have offered the 6-year Integrated Programme (IP) to boys
and girls, where they spend 4 years in their respective secondary schools
before moving to VJC for two years before attempting the GCE ‘A’ Levels.
<br>
</p>
<p>Bonded by a shared belief to prepare our students for the 21st century,
we nurture our students to their full potential and develop every student
to be a Social Innovator, Passionate Learner. Today the partnership extends
to CCA collaborations, student leadership development and talent development
to ensure that our students benefit from the alliance.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>We warmly welcome you to embark on this exciting 6-year journey with us.

<p>Philosophy of Education</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Innovators, Passionate Learners</em></strong> 
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The VCA IP curriculum is future-oriented and it encourages students to
respect ideas, pursue excellence and celebrate discoveries. The VCA IP
demands students’ full participation so that individuals may develop their
personal voice and identity and stretch their potential.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The VCA IP expects students to take strong ownership of their learning
and to seek and create opportunities for their education so that, in the
process, students may develop a passion for knowledge and equip themselves
with the essential skills and intellectual habits of a lifelong learner.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Education at the VCA IP empowers students to challenge and to lead. The
VCA IP requires students to assume responsibility for personal actions
and to exercise intellectual and moral courage. The scholarship and collegiality
it fosters in its students should lead them, in their later lives, to promote
understanding between people and to strive for the betterment of their
country and the world.</p>

<p>Imagineering Programme</p>
<p>A signature programme of the VCA IP, the Imagineering Programme aims to
nurture social innovators. It is the main platform through which students’
innovative capacity is developed and honed to provide them with the vital
skills they need to create breakthrough solutions to real problems in a
fast-changing world.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Using Design Thinking as the approach, the Imagineering Programme helps
students gain a deeper understanding of social issues and develop empathy
and a desire to impact the community positively. It equips them with the
skills and knowledge so that they can design innovative solutions to improve
the lives of others.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><em>Years 1 &amp; 2</em> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Students develop basic skills and attributes in Design Thinking and apply
them to classroom-based and school-based issues.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><em>Years 3 &amp; 4</em> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Working in partnership with Singapore University of Technology and Design
(SUTD) and South-East Community Development Council (South-East CDC), students
deepen their mastery of Design Thinking tools through engagement with real
issues in society. In Year 4, students are encouraged to work on their
own Social Innovation project.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><em>Years 5 &amp; 6</em> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Students further hone their Design Thinking skills and knowledge by serving
as peer leaders during Project Work lessons. Students are encouraged to
initiate Values-in-Action projects to benefit the community around them.</p>
