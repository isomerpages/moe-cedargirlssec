<p>The Cedar Humanities Department aims to nurture in our Cedarians a passion for the Humanities. We see the importance in developing and equipping Cedarians with the skills and dispositions of a Geographer and a Historian, which we believe are essential in the development of important life skills like collaboration, critical thinking and communication.</p>

<div>

<p>
<b>1.    Critical thinking and Alternative Assessment tasks</b><br><br>

Our teachers believe in using a variety of teaching strategies and experiences to engage students and develop their interests in the Humanities. They are passionate about designing lessons that include ICT, peer teaching, inquiry based learning and experiential learning to develop critical-thinking skills, civic literacy and global awareness. Our curriculum also provides Cedarians with the opportunity to apply the skills acquired from the Humanities lessons through Alternative Assessment tasks which are framed by current affairs and social issues, both local and international.<br><br>

  

<b>2.    Use of technology</b><br><br>

As Singapore progresses towards a SMART nation, the Department has also innovated in the use of ICT in teaching and learning. We have incorporated an amalgamation of ICT tools in our classrooms such as Google-classroom, Mentimeter, Padlet, Kahoot and many more.  One key initiative in our Department is the infusion of Virtual Reality in lessons where Cedarians have the opportunity to enjoy an immersive experience to places ranging from famous local heritage sites to the Great Wonders of the world, all from their seats in the classroom. ICT tools also enable students to collaborate with one another and widen their perspectives by learning from peers and teachers.

<b>1.  **Beyond Borders Programme (Vietnam)</b><br><br>

The Beyond Borders programme is a six-day overseas Learning Journey to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Students learn to better appreciate and develop greater social awareness of social issues in Vietnam and Singapore. With a visit to a Vietnamese school, students foster international understanding, collaboration and bonding with the Vietnamese students. As part of the programme, students have to investigate how the geographical location and history influenced the development of Vietnam.<br><br>
