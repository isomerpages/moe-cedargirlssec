### Instructional Programmes

  

At Cedar Girls', we provide meaningful and authentic learning experiences for our pupils to nurture their intellectual capacity through a spectrum of educational experiences in all disciplines.

We use a repertoire of pedagogical approaches spanning Socratic Questioning, Field Work, Problem-based Learning and Inquiry Approach to deliver the formal curriculum. There is curriculum differentiation to cater to the varied learning needs of our pupils while consciously fostering critical and inventive thinking to prepare Cedarians for the 21st century.
