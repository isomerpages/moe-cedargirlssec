<p>
Mathematics is very important as it permeates every aspect of our daily lives. Our differentiated approach strives to maximise the potential of every student in the subject. Problem Solving is the central theme of our Integrated Mathematics Programme. The pentagon framework shows the underlying principles of the Integrated Mathematics Programme. It sets the direction for the teaching, learning and assessment of Mathematics.

<label for="accordion2">Teaching and Learning Approach</label>

<div>

<p>
Mathematics is an excellent vehicle for the development and improvement of a person’s intellectual competence in logical reasoning, spatial visualisation, analysis and abstract thought. Pupils need to recognise and appreciate the links between various components of Mathematics, the relationship between Mathematics and other disciplines, as well as the relevance and importance of Mathematics in real life situations.
<br><br>
The Cedar Mathematics education provides learning opportunities and platforms for pupils to acquire and apply creative thinking and problem solving skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real world problems. These authentic learning experiences will enable our pupils to meet the challenges of the 21st century successfully where critical and creative thinking skills are highly valued.<br><br>

1.  The Level 3 Maths Learning Journey seeks to allow students to apply Maths concepts in a fun and meaningful way in real world contexts. It also allows students to appreciate the relevance of Maths in daily life and the inter-connectedness of various subject disciplines. <br><br>

<b>2.  Maths Talent Development Programme</b><br><br>
Central to the Maths Talent Development Programme is the Maths Olympiad Programme which seeks to develop the problem solving skills of those students who are passionate in Mathematics. These students undergo a structured training programme and take part in various competitions, e.g. the Singapore Maths Olympiad and the Australian Mathematics Competition etc to hone their problem solving skills.<br><br>

  

The Research Programme aims to develop students’ intellectual capabilities, subject-related interests, knowledge and skills necessary for the workplace of the future. Students who are involved in the Maths Research projects are also mentored for the Singapore Maths Project Festival.<br><br>

<label for="accordion4">Assessment</label>

<div>

<p>
In Cedar, the assessment principles are based on the belief that assessment is used as a feedback mechanism to address learning gaps in pupils so that pupils can adjust their learning tactics, and for teachers to consider their intervention strategies. The Mathematics Department uses both pen and paper and alternative modes of assessment. Pen and paper assessments include class tests and examinations. Alternative modes of assessments include formative assessments such as Performance Tasks, Graded Assignments and Project Work.
