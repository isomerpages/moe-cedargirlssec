<p>Mathematics is very important as it permeates every aspect of our daily lives. Our differentiated approach strives to maximise the potential of every student in the subject. Problem Solving is the central theme of our Integrated Mathematics Programme. The pentagon framework shows the underlying principles of the Integrated Mathematics Programme. It sets the direction for the teaching, learning and assessment of Mathematics.</p>

<div>

<p>
Mathematics is an excellent vehicle for the development and improvement of a person’s intellectual competence in logical reasoning, spatial visualisation, analysis and abstract thought. Pupils need to recognise and appreciate the links between various components of Mathematics, the relationship between Mathematics and other disciplines, as well as the relevance and importance of Mathematics in real life situations.
<br><br>
The Cedar Mathematics education provides learning opportunities and platforms for pupils to acquire and apply creative thinking and problem solving skills in a wide range of situations, including non-routine, open-ended and real world problems. These authentic learning experiences will enable our pupils to meet the challenges of the 21st century successfully where critical and creative thinking skills are highly valued.<br><br>
