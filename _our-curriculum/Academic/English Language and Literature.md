<p>Cedar’s English department uses the Parallel Curriculum Model (PCM) as
a tool for curriculum planning. At the Core of the curriculum are language
skills and literary concepts which are scaffold in spiral progression across
the students’ four years in the school. The Curriculum of Connections explores
age-appropriate macro concepts and themes which act as conduits for the
application of learning from the Core Curriculum.</p>
<p>In the Curriculum of Practice, students experience authentic tasks where
they learn how to act as practitioners in specially curated contexts. Finally,
in the Curriculum of Identity, students’ are given platforms and opportunities
to explore their personal stance in social issues around the world.</p>
<p>The curriculum is delivered using the social constructivist approach with
a strong focus on collaborative and discovery learning to enhance the joy
of learning. Since language is a skills-based subject which is often intuitive
to the proficient user, pedagogies which promote active learning and greater
student engagement are employed, and emphasis is placed on making thinking
visible. Teachers model questioning such as using the Think Aloud strategy
to show students how to use questioning techniques to critically evaluate
what they read.</p>
<p>We have incorporated teaching questioning techniques such as Socratic
Questioning in our IP curriculum as a tool to enable our students to think
critically and deeply. Differentiated Instruction is also carried out to
cater to differing student needs. To ensure that students are future-ready,
ICT is integrated into the curriculum through the use of Google Classroom,
Google suite for Education and various web 2.0 tools. Students are also
taught how to responsibly utilise various Artificial Intelligence tools
to augment their learning.</p>
