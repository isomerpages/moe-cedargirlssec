<p>The Cedar Prefectorial Board (CPB) comprises of Prefect Councillors who
are passionate and driven individuals who strive to make a positive impact
in the Cedar community. Only pupils who are exemplary in conduct and adopt
a positive attitude in life are given the opportunity to take on the challenge
of becoming a Prefect Councillor to serve the school. Together, PCs work
towards creating a strong school identity, culture and a better environment
for all Cedarians. They embody the Cedar identity and lead by example by
living out the school motto of Honesty, Courtesy and Perseverance. Through
events and trainings, CPB creates opportunities for every Prefect Councillor
to grow and nurture skills essential in daily life. Some of our signature
events include our Blue, Yellow and Grey Day, where we aim to foster a
greater school spirit and Our Cedar Conversation, an opportunity for the
voices of the student body to be heard via our leaders. In Cedar, CPB is
a unique family that inspires all!</p>

<p>The Cedar Peer Support Board strives to develop student leaders with skills
that enable them to lead, champion and advocate Peer Support Relationship
(PSR) efforts among Cedarians. The Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) aspire to
inspire their peers with 'P'assion, 'S'ynergy and 'L'ove. As part of the
class committee, PSLs work alongside the Class Monitresses to organise
class-based activities to encourage peer bonding and peer helping. This
is done through our level-based â€˜Peer Bonding &amp; Jamming' sessions,
allowing our PSLs to conduct classroom-based activities to strengthen relationships
among classmates. The various planned activities enable Cedarians to build
camaraderie with one another and impart skills and knowledge for self-care
and ways to support others. PSLs also influence one another and their peers
to exhibit positive behaviours, embodying the values of leadership and
care for their peers. They actively contribute to the well-being of the
student body by synergising efforts with their fellow student leaders to
support school-wide programmes.</p>

across various facets of the school journey and transforming classrooms
into families. class monitresses facilitate dynamic and inclusive circle
time sessions, empowering their peers to express themselves, fostering
social-emotional growth, and forging meaningful connections. They play
a pivotal role in shaping the vibrant atmosphere at Cedar by spearheading
annual events, creating unforgettable experiences, and enriching the school
community through their leadership and coordination.</p>

to 3 training sessions annually. These sessions, characterised by interactivity,
encourage participation, collaboration, and experiential learning. Through
engaging discussions, real-life case studies, and hands-on activities,
students continually refine their leadership skills.</p>
