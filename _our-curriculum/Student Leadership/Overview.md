### Student Leadership

It is our school vision to nurture Women of Character and Wisdom. The school believes that everyone has the potential to exercise leadership and effect positive change for the betterment of others.  Every Cedarian is put through an extensive and rigorous leadership programme as part of their Cedar Leadership Experience (CLE).

Every Cedarian is given **Exposure** through cohort wide training programmes and leadership opportunities within the classroom and beyond. These **Exposures** are aimed at equipping the students with the appropriate skillsets to be able to navigate through increasingly complex situations in an ever evolving world. With these skills, students will then **Experience** leadership at various levels, and working with diverse groups of peers, and apply the knowledge they have gained. Through these **Experiences**, students will grow themselves with grit and in line with the school values, ZEST. Having had these experiences, students will **Extend** their leadership to their peers within Cedar and in the community. We strive to develop each student to become a thoughtful, skilled and reflective leader, who is empowered to further develop her leadership as she moves onto her next phase of life and be representative of the excellence that the CLE stands for.

The following table shows some of the leadership opportunities we cater to students through the various platforms.
