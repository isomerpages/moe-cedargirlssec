<h3>Student Leadership</h3>
<p>It is our school vision to nurture Women of Character and Wisdom. The
school believes that everyone has the potential to exercise leadership
and effect positive change for the betterment of others.&nbsp; Every Cedarian
is put through an extensive and rigorous leadership programme as part of
their Cedar Leadership Experience (CLE).</p>

<p>Every Cedarian is given&nbsp;<strong>Exposure</strong>&nbsp;through cohort
wide training programmes and leadership opportunities within the classroom
and beyond. These&nbsp;<strong>Exposures</strong>&nbsp;are aimed at equipping
the students with the appropriate skillsets to be able to navigate through
increasingly complex situations in an ever evolving world. With these skills,
students will then&nbsp;<strong>Experience</strong>&nbsp;leadership at
various levels, and working with diverse groups of peers, and apply the
knowledge they have gained. Through these&nbsp;<strong>Experiences</strong>,
students will grow themselves with grit and in line with the school values,
ZEST. Having had these experiences, students will&nbsp;<strong>Extend</strong>&nbsp;their
leadership to their peers within Cedar and in the community. We strive
to develop each student to become a thoughtful, skilled and reflective
leader, who is empowered to further develop her leadership as she moves
onto her next phase of life and be representative of the excellence that
the CLE stands for.</p>
<p>The following table shows some of the leadership opportunities we cater
to students through the various platforms.</p>
