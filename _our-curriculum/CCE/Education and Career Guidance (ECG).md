<p>Cedar Girlsâ€™ Secondary School takes a holistic approach when planning
and carrying out our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes. Throughout
the four years in school, our students will go through compulsory classroom
ECG lessons where they discover about themselves, find out their strengths
through personality tests and be informed about pre-requisites of post-secondary
education and so as to make the right choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school organises for the students customised Learning Journeys to
organisation of their choice, talks by Experts from various fields of work
and Career Exhibitions where all the local Universities, Junior Colleges,
Polytechnics and various government organisations are invited to set up
booths to share with our students information about the various courses
and jobs in Singapore. Our students are also encouraged to take up internships
in Year 3 or Year 4 with any organisation of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least, the school also organises workshops on interview,
communication and life skills (e.g. Dining Etiquette) so as to prepare
our students for the VUCA world. All these are aimed at equipping our students
with the necessary knowledge, skills and values so that they can make informed
post-secondary education and career decisions.</p>
