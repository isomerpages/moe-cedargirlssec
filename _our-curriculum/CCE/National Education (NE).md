National Education (NE) in Cedar aims to nurture our students into Concerned Citizens, Inspiring Confident Leaders and Active Social Innovators.

The NE experience in Cedar encompasses a variety of learning activities for the 4 commemorative NE days as well as educational learning journeys to allow students to deepen their knowledge and understanding of Singapore's history, geography and culture. Students are also offered the opportunity to learn from distinguished guests in our annual NE Lecture Series, which covers topics such as ‘Racial Harmony & Integration’, Our Water Story, Threats to Singapore etc.
