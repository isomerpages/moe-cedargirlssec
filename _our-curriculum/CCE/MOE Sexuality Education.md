<h4><strong>CEDAR GIRLS’ SECONDARY SCHOOL</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Moe Sexuality Education in Schools</strong></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support students in managing their physiological,
social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy
relationships.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide students to make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students develop a moral compass
and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values
and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic
unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality
Education are:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and respect yourself as you love
and respect others;</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build positive relationships based on
love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible decisions for
yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence before marriage is the best
protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can
harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<h4>Overview of Cedar Girls’ Secondary School’s Sexuality Education Programme for 2026</h4>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered in a

Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and
Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for more

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics

<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons:</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our youth
towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the
media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage
in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity and
often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence
(generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents.
The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in
a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including
sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences
that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance
can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly.
Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves
and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth,
personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of
sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education lessons,
secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem,
develop their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire
of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of
prime concern at this age.</p>
<h4><strong>At Cedar Girls’ Secondary School, the following Sexuality Education lessons will be taught in <u>2026</u>:</strong></h4>

<p><strong>eTeens Programme:</strong>
</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eTeens is a programme that was developed
by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education,
to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV
and protection from a health perspective. With the formation of the Communicable
Diseases Agency (CDA) on 1 April 2025, the programme would now be managed
by CDA’s Training and Education Division instead of HPB. eTeens is conducted
in two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.
The desired outcome of the eTeens programme is that students are empowered
to make wise, informed and sensible decisions to protect themselves from
sexually transmitted infectious diseases.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such as decision-making,
assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure.
They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and
involves their family, and the importance of responsible decision-making
and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages.</p>
