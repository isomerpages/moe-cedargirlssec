(b)  discussing a broad range of issues which will widen students' world view<br> (c)  developing students into outstanding critical thinkers and effective communicators <br>
(d)  providing opportunities for students to explore their areas of interest more deeply<br>
(e) providing enriching experiences that are not typically available in the school curriculum to broaden students' perspective and deepen learning.

#### Thematic Concerns

Thematic Concerns form the underlying structure of the HSP modules which are taught over two years. The goal of the thematic approach is to draw explicit links across disciplines and to scaffold the understanding of these disciplines in a structured and systemic way.
