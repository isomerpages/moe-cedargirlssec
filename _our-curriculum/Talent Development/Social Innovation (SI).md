<p>### ABOUT CSI</p>
<p>#### <strong>THE CENTRE FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION</strong>
</p>
<p>The Cedar Centre for Social Innovation is set up to be a nexus for social
innovation, to inspire, create and share best practices. We seek to instill
a mindset and disposition towards innovative practices for social causes,
and enhance society’s capacity to act.</p>
<p>### <strong>CSI INC LOGO</strong>
</p>
<p>&lt;img style="width:40%" src="/images/csi1.png"&gt;</p>
<p>This vibrant and youthful design brings out the value of empathy, seen
in the colourful shape of a heart on the right, formed by people holding
hands, symbolising our community. Another heart tops the logo and represents
a soaring eagle, inspiring our students to scale to greater heights as
social innovators. The three letter ‘i’s in the words ‘social innovation’
show how, with the value of empathy, individuals can come together as a
community to break new ground and innovate for social good.</p>
<p>### <strong>Three tenets of CSI</strong>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Incubating Spaces</strong>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>The school is an environment where students can incubate their ideas and
bring their social innovations to fruition. We provide facilities and spaces
to enable students to explore, experiment, connect, collaborate and co-create
solutions with one another. With the support of teacher mentors and industry
professionals, students apply their knowledge and bring their proposed
user-centric ideas to reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Nexus</strong>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>The Cedar Center for Social Innovation aims to be a nexus that brings
communities and ideas together. We bring together those who share the same
passion to discuss social issues and challenges, share best practices,
and deepen learning and broaden perspectives of students so as to inspire
them to create novel solutions that will impact the community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Capacity Building</strong>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>Through our Social Innovation and Research (SIR) curriculum, undergirded
by Stanford University’s Design Thinking approach, the school aims to buid
up students’ competency and nurture in them attributes that would develop
them into social innovators. Since 2019, the school has also established
a Talent Development Programme for Social Innovation for students with
a passion to deepen their involvement and develop themselves into future
leaders in Social Innovation.</p>
<p>### <strong>Our Journey</strong>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>In 2022, Cedar celebrated 10 years of Social Innovation and produced an
e-book detailing our growth from our nascent beginnings to establishing
ourselves as a Center for Social Innovation. The commemorative book also
highlights some of the school’s achievements in social innovation over
the years. &lt;br&gt;</p>
