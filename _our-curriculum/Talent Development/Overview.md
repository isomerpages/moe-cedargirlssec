<h3>Talent Development (TD)</h3>
<p>Our talent development philosophy views Cedarians as budding talents with
different gifts and interests that could be nurtured and developed over
time to achieve their potential. The quest for excellence by Cedarians
is done in a safe environment where they are full-heartedly supported by
teachers and peers in their endeavours. Through this journey of self-discovery
and talent development, our students better understand where to apply their
gifts, craft their portfolios and build themselves up into women of character
and wisdom. We are proud of our girls who positively contribute to the
community with their various talents and passions.</p>
<p>Cedar’s talent development programme follows the three Es – Exposure,
Experience and Extension. These refer to the different tiers of engagement
and complexity, upon which our programmes and activities are designed and
structured on. Talent engagement may occur both in and out of the classroom.</p>
