<label for="accordion2">Science Research Programme (SRP)</label>

<div>

<p>
Cedar Science Research Programme (SRP) aims to spark interest for Science research and equip students with knowledge and skills in undertaking a Science research project.   <br><br>

  

Rich learning opportunities for students are provided in the form of:  <br><br>

  

<b>1. Knowledge and skills acquisition via a lecture series and workshop conducted by Science Centre</b> - students learn about the different stages of carrying out a Science research project and acquire data analytical skills for application in Science research.<br><br>

  

<b>2. Undertaking of research projects to apply learning to real-world context</b> - in groups, students are encouraged to explore their areas of interest in Science and challenged to define a research question for investigation.<br><br>

  

Through the development of their research projects, students learn about the disposition of a Science researcher and hone their critical thinking skills. At the end of this learning experience, students are recognised with the SRP certificate for completion of their research projects. <br><br>

  

<b>3. Participation in Science research fairs and competitions at National and Zonal levels</b> – selected student groups are provided with opportunities to showcase their research work at national and zonal platforms such as Singapore Youth Science Fair, East Zone A\*Star Science Fair and Singapore Youth Science Conference to further enhance their skills in scientific communication.

<b>Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad (SJBO)</b>

SJBO provides a platform for upper secondary students to challenge themselves further in the area of biology, and is an initiative built on their strong grasp on fundamentals. SJBO also gives students an early taste of the International Biology Olympiad, in which the Singapore team has consistently ranked within the top 3 for the past 6 years, as further testament to how our students can excel if pushed. As such, SJBO will focus on critical thinking skills as applied to biology, and it is hoped that students develop a holistic culture and passion in learning and applying biology in their lives.

<b>Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad (SJChO)</b>

SJChO is a competition organised by the Singapore National Institute of Chemistry (SNIC) in partnership with NUS, NTU, SUTD and Nanyang Polytechnic and supported by the Ministry of Education (MOE). SJChO provides a platform for all upper secondary (or equivalent levels) students to challenge themselves in their chemical knowledge and skills. It also seeks to promote the excitement in learning and doing Chemistry as well as to identify and develop chemistry talents.

<b>Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad (SJPO)</b>

SJPO is a physics competition organized by the Institute of Physics, Singapore (IPS) for secondary school students. This annual competition aims to encourage the study and appreciation of physics beyond the school curriculum, by providing an opportunity for students to solve novel questions that require critical and inventive thinking.
