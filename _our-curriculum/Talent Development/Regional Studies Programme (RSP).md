<div>

<p>
The Regional Studies Programme (RSP) is a six-year scholarship programme offered only to five secondary schools in Singapore with a seamless progression to three junior colleges, including Victoria Junior College. The main objective of the programme is to nurture a group of students who are conversant in Malay Language and sensitised to the cultural, socio-economic and political developments of the ASEAN countries. Through the learning of Malay Special Programme (MSP) as their third language, this enhances their understanding and experience of cultures in the region. Our RSP students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in authentic settings of the dynamic cultures of our neighbouring countries through experiential learning and activities that are conducted in Singapore or through our biennial overseas exchange trips.
