**Maths Talent Development Programme**

Central to the Maths Talent Development Programme is the Maths Olympiad Programme which seeks to develop the problem solving skills of those students who are passionate in Mathematics. These students undergo a structured training programme and take part in various competitions, e.g. the Singapore Maths Olympiad and the Australian Mathematics Competition etc to hone their problem solving skills.

  

The Research Programme aims to develop studentsâ€™ intellectual capabilities, subject-related interests, knowledge and skills necessary for the workplace of the future. Students who are involved in the Maths Research projects are also mentored for the Singapore Maths Project Festival.
