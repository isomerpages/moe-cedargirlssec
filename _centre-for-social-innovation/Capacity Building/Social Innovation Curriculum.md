### Social Innovation and Research (SIR) Curriculum

Cedar Girls’ Secondary School has a rigorous and well grounded academic programme that prepares our students for the emerging and changing needs of the world. The Social Innovation and Research curriculum complements this with a focus on empathy-driven social innovations. Students are challenged to come up with these innovations using the Design Thinking framework and thinking tools taught to them over their four years. 

Design Thinking is a simple framework that can help us to come up with creative solutions for others. It brings us through 5 stages — Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Testing / Feedback. During Cedarians’ time in Cedar, they will be involved in social innovation projects that make use of Design Thinking.
