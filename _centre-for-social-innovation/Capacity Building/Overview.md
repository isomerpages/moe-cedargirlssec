### Capacity Building

Our Approach

Capacity building focuses on building up the competency levels of students.  Besides imparting our students with design thinking skills, we hope our students gain greater sensitivity to social issues, challenge the process for breakthrough ideas and lead with compassion.<br><br>
A talent development programme has been established in 2019 for the students to deepen their passion and advocacy to drive innovation for social causes in a bigger way.<br><br>
With these opportunities and programmes, we aim to develop the C.R.E.A.T.E attributes - Curious, Resilient, Experimental, Action-biased, Team Player, Empathetic in all our students.
