### Capacity Building

**Capacity building** focuses on building up the competency levels of students. It aims to equip students with design thinking skills through the school’s Imagineering Programme, and Singapore teachers through workshops conducted at the VCA Design Thinking Academy.  

A talent development programme has been established in 2019 for the students to deepen their passion and advocacy to drive innovation for social causes in a bigger way.
