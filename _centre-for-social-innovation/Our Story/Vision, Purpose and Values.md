### VISION

Bringing Out the Best in our People:Â   

Social Innovators, Passionate Learners.

### OUR PURPOSE

The Centre for Social Innovation is set up to be a nexus for social innovation, to inspire, create and share practice that will instill a mindset and disposition towards innovative practices for social causes.  

  

### OUR VALUES

*   Empathy
*   Compassion
*   Social and Moral Responsibility
*   Open-Mindedness
*   Respecting Others  
    

  

By engaging our students with authentic social issues, we hope to nurture them to be leaders of character, who are able to consider the feelings and perspectives of others. We also hope that they will be advocates for social change, being able to inspire others by creating solutions to the social issues they have identified.
