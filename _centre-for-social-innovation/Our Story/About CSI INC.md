### ABOUT CSI INC

#### THE CENTRE FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION

  

**About CSI** (the INC refers to Incubating Spaces, Nexus and Capacity Building, but I don’t think we need it in the title)<br>
The **Cedar** Centre for Social Innovation is set up to be a nexus for social innovation, to inspire, create and share best practices. We seek to instill a mindset and disposition towards innovative practices for social causes, and enhance society’s capacity to act. 

#### CSI INC LOGO

This vibrant and youthful design brings out the value of empathy, seen in the colourful shape of a heart on the right, formed by people holding hands, symbolising our community. Another heart tops the logo and represents a soaring eagle, inspiring our students to scale to greater heights as social innovators. The three letter ‘i’s in the words ‘social innovation’ show how, with the value of empathy, individuals can come together as a community to break new ground and innovate for social good.
