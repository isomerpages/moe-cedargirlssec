By engaging students in design challenges spanning across different industries (e.g. healthcare, volunteerism, environmental issues) to improve the lives of people, students are given the opportunities to develop various life skills such as teamwork, marketing and pitching. <br><br>In 2019, two groups of Cedarians participated in the Prudential Young Trailblazers. One group promoted their solution of a handphone application that acted as a catalogue to families to various popular events and activities near them that they could participate in together. The judges of the competition liked the intuitive layout and built-in booking features of the application, which would have enabled families to not only conveniently find events that suit their schedules and needs, but also purchase their tickets within the application. This group advanced to the finals of the competition that year.<br><br><img src="/images/sia21.png" style="width:80%"><br><br>Cedar Dynamics - Ho Wen Xuan (3A), Chin Zi Xuan Sharlene (3C), <br>Claire Ella Chia En (3M)<br>Cedar Fortis - Krystle Koh Xuan Fang (3I), Oh Yi Hui Eliora (3I), <br>Faith Chua Hwe Ing (3I), Baswa Sai Dueepti (3I) |

The resources went through several iterations to improve on their usability and aesthetic appeal, after multiple rounds of feedback. The students presented their ideas at the MOE Gifted Education Branch Young Innovator’s Fair, and also to Minister Ng Chee Meng for the School 60th Anniversary Dinner.<br><br>Brigette Teo (4O), Lam Kai Yi Karen (4I), Shah Shaily Parag (4Z)<br><br>Exercise Cube <br>This group of students devised a portable basketball hoop set which helped the elderly actively improve their muscle strength and exercise tolerance.
