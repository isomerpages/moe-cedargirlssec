<td>Description of Project</td>
<td>In this project, used sheet masks were repurposed into reusable whiteboard dusters that were more effective than the commercial Artline magnetic duster, used in our school, in terms of dust retention and cleaning efficiency. This initiative gives a second life to single used sheet masks, which contribute to environmental pollution due to their non-biodegradable nature, and also addresses the frequent replacement of non-environmentally friendly foam and felt whiteboard dusters. The duster was made for teachers and students in the classroom, who find it troublesome to clean the whiteboard well due to the duster being old and worn out.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Description of Project</td>
<td>In order to reduce harm caused to our environment, we are encouraged to pick up the habit to replace single-use plastic bags with reusable ones. However, many tend to forget to bring our reusable bags out with us. This leads to paying for single-use ones at the shops or even buying additional reusable bags. These purchases further add to the harmful impact on the environment as more materials are being used to meet our demands for bags. Thus, we designed Pocketz in hopes to resolve this issue. Pocketz is a reusable bag that acts as a pocket that you can attach to your clothes or bags, making the reusable bags more convenient to use and bring about.</td>

<td>Description of Project</td>
<td>In this project, a spray was made from flavonoids extracted from pineapple biowaste, which can be used on clothing to effectively protect human skin against harmful UV rays. It was observed that many suffer from sunburns after exposure to UV rays for an extensive period of time. However, not everyone is able to apply UV protective creams such as sunscreen directly on their skin due to sensitivity or allergies. This drove our team to innovate a UV resistant liquid spray which can be applied onto clothing, effectively resolving adverse health impacts of UV rays on human skin. Moreover, burning, discarding, or landfilling pineapple biowaste could increase the risk of global warming. As such, pineapple biowaste, such as its unwanted skin and leaves, were recycled in the creation of this UV-resistant spray, inducing an innovation towards a circular economy.

<td>Description of Project</td>
<td>The Scrub-it! is a water wheel with a sponge attached to the centre. The flow of water from the water source will be directed to cleaning the plate as well as turning the wheel. This allows for those with function in only 1 hand to wash plates and save water and electricity. Our solution does not require much water or electricity to work, thus it is a sustainable method of washing plates effectively. It is built such that users with function in only 1 hand can still wash their plates with ease and still clean off tough stains.

<td>Description of Project</td>
<td>HYPERKS was created to help teenagers with ADHD who are aware of their condition but are unaware of how to manage it due to their hyperactivity. ADHD is an invisible disability that is often overlooked, thus the group wanted to use this opportunity to shed light on the ADHD community. HYPERKS aims to help teenagers with ADHD focus better via 3 main components – Productivity, Health and Community.<br><br>
	Productivity breaks down complex tasks into more manageable steps, transferring them to a tasklist which can be checked off once completed. Health consists of meditation and exercises, providing an avenue for these teens to channel their excess energy and enhance their overall well-being. Community consists of avatars and a reward system to incentivise these teens to continue using our app, serving as a motivation to complete tasks/ exercises.&nbsp;</td>

	The group hopes to pioneer in a <strong>unique innovation for a marginalised group </strong>and pave the way to cultivate inclusivity as the norm in our society. The group focused on household chores that pose a larger safety hazard to the blind such as ironing. <strong>Group has designed an iron with safety features for the blind to reduce their risk of burns</strong>.</td>

<td>The group has created an AI-enabled application prototype called FROGGY (Future-Ready Orientation through Gamification and Goal-setting for Youths) that allows youths to learn about their current gaps, equips them with future-ready skills to prepare for the future of the workforce and monitor their progress. The app evaluates users’ competency in 10 key areas to be future-ready based on a gamification approach, similar to how Minecraft and Roblox work. Using an AI system, it will generate a personalised report about the user’s strengths, weaknesses, and profile. It will also recommend areas for improvement, as well as provide a variety of courses, workshops and tips</td>
