<p>In this project, used sheet masks were repurposed into reusable whiteboard
dusters that were more effective than the commercial Artline magnetic duster,
used in our school, in terms of dust retention and cleaning efficiency.
This initiative gives a second life to single used sheet masks, which contribute
to environmental pollution due to their non-biodegradable nature, and also
addresses the frequent replacement of non-environmentally friendly foam
and felt whiteboard dusters. The duster was made for teachers and students
in the classroom, who find it troublesome to clean the whiteboard well
due to the duster being old and worn out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to reduce harm caused to our environment, we are encouraged to
pick up the habit to replace single-use plastic bags with reusable ones.
However, many tend to forget to bring our reusable bags out with us. This
leads to paying for single-use ones at the shops or even buying additional
reusable bags. These purchases further add to the harmful impact on the
environment as more materials are being used to meet our demands for bags.
Thus, we designed Pocketz in hopes to resolve this issue. Pocketz is a
reusable bag that acts as a pocket that you can attach to your clothes
or bags, making the reusable bags more convenient to use and bring about.</p>

<p>In this project, a spray was made from flavonoids extracted from pineapple
biowaste, which can be used on clothing to effectively protect human skin
against harmful UV rays. It was observed that many suffer from sunburns
after exposure to UV rays for an extensive period of time. However, not
everyone is able to apply UV protective creams such as sunscreen directly
on their skin due to sensitivity or allergies. This drove our team to innovate
a UV resistant liquid spray which can be applied onto clothing, effectively
resolving adverse health impacts of UV rays on human skin. Moreover, burning,
discarding, or landfilling pineapple biowaste could increase the risk of
global warming. As such, pineapple biowaste, such as its unwanted skin
and leaves, were recycled in the creation of this UV-resistant spray, inducing
an innovation towards a circular economy.</p>

<p>The Scrub-it! is a water wheel with a sponge attached to the centre. The
flow of water from the water source will be directed to cleaning the plate
as well as turning the wheel. This allows for those with function in only
1 hand to wash plates and save water and electricity. Our solution does
not require much water or electricity to work, thus it is a sustainable
method of washing plates effectively. It is built such that users with
function in only 1 hand can still wash their plates with ease and still
clean off tough stains.</p>

<p>Annually, e-commerce contributes to a total of 17.7 million kilograms
of packaging waste and Singapore’s only landfill, Semaukau is set to be
fully filled by 2035. Therefore, our solution, MOLU, aims to replace simple
and ineffective plastic packaging with a more functional and more environmentally
sustainable alternative made entirely from natural materials! MOLU has
an interlocking feature between each layer forming a protective barrier
to protect e-commerce goods when shipped and can be returned back to Singpost
for recycling, reusing the materials to make more MOLUs and reducing the
amount of waste produced from packaging. Additionally, MOLU is water-soluble
and also has fertiliser properties to better aid plants’ growth. MOLU also
has enhanced protective features to protect the goods and is more environmentally
healthy. With this product, even one small MOLU-cule can have a big impact
on our environment and contribute to a better earth!</p>

<p>HappyFeet is our innovative sock design targeting foot pain relief, particularly
among the elderly, to enhance sleep quality and overall well-being. Research
revealed that foot pains are prevalent among elderly, and are commonly
caused by arthritis, gout, and neuropathy. They are highly discomforting
and disrupt sleep, often leading to insomnia. Thus, HappyFeet is here to
provide soothing massages and alleviate pain. It is a dual-layered sock
containing embedded acupuncture stones infused with medicated oil, and
battery-powered massage rollers. It is also lined with thick cotton for
extra comfort. Inspired by UN SDG 3, our mission is to enhance the health
and well-being of elderly by reducing foot pain for more quality sleep,
resulting in higher health and energy levels. With the global foot care
products market on the rise, HappyFeet offers a unique 3-in-1 solution
that stands out for its non-invasive and convenient approach to foot pain
management. .</p>

<p>HYPERKS was created to help teenagers with ADHD who are aware of their
condition but are unaware of how to manage it due to their hyperactivity.
ADHD is an invisible disability that is often overlooked, thus the group
wanted to use this opportunity to shed light on the ADHD community. HYPERKS
aims to help teenagers with ADHD focus better via 3 main components – Productivity,
Health and Community.
<br>
<br>Productivity breaks down complex tasks into more manageable steps, transferring
them to a tasklist which can be checked off once completed. Health consists
of meditation and exercises, providing an avenue for these teens to channel
their excess energy and enhance their overall well-being. Community consists
of avatars and a reward system to incentivise these teens to continue using
our app, serving as a motivation to complete tasks/ exercises.&nbsp;</p>

their progress. The app evaluates users’ competency in 10 key areas to
be future-ready based on a gamification approach, similar to how Minecraft

about the user’s strengths, weaknesses, and profile. It will also recommend
