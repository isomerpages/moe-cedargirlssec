<td>Description of Project</td>
<td>HYPERKS was created to help teenagers with ADHD who are aware of their condition but are unaware of how to manage it due to their hyperactivity. ADHD is an invisible disability that is often overlooked, thus the group wanted to use this opportunity to shed light on the ADHD community. HYPERKS aims to help teenagers with ADHD focus better via 3 main components – Productivity, Health and Community.Productivity breaks down complex tasks into more manageable steps, transferring them to a tasklist which can be checked off once completed. Health consists of meditation and exercises, providing an avenue for these teens to channel their excess energy and enhance their overall well-being. Community consists of avatars and a reward system to incentivise these teens to continue using our app, serving as a motivation to complete tasks/ exercises.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Envision a world where everyone has equal opportunities, no matter how old you are or what disability you have — this is the goal of A-ron. The group hopes to pioneer in a <strong>unique innovation for a marginalised group </strong>and pave the way to cultivate inclusivity as the norm in our society. The group focused on household chores that pose a larger safety hazard to the blind such as ironing. <strong>Group has designed an iron with safety features for the blind to reduce their risk of burns</strong>.</td>

<td>Description of Project</td>
<td>The group has created an AI-enabled application prototype called FROGGY (Future-Ready Orientation through Gamification and Goal-setting for Youths) that allows youths to learn about their current gaps, equips them with future-ready skills to prepare for the future of the workforce and monitor their progress. The app evaluates users’ competency in 10 key areas to be future-ready based on a gamification approach, similar to how Minecraft and Roblox work. Using an AI system, it will generate a personalised report about the user’s strengths, weaknesses, and profile. It will also recommend areas for improvement, as well as provide a variety of courses, workshops and tips</td>
