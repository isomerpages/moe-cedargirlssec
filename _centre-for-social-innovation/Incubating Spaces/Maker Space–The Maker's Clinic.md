### Maker Space–The Maker's Clinic

**2021 Year 2 Digitalization for Youths programme**

  

Our Year 2 Cedarians immersed themselves in 10 hours of computational thinking and coding through the Digitalisation for Youths Programme. In addition to learning what is computation thinking with a fun session of Cardboard Blokies, students learnt how microcontrollers work, coding different electronic components as well as how to predict the behaviour of simple programs.

Through this, they learnt to make prototypes that require wireless connectivity with a variety of components. Students had interactive challenges and a fun mini-project where they were posed a real-world problem statement and worked together to build a sustainability and accessibility enhancement prototype for a Smart Home and School Gadgets.

The workshop was indeed a fruitful and enriching experience. I was able to learn coding skills as well as programming. This is  useful in various ways like for our SI projects and our own individual projects that we choose to embark on as technology is developing and becoming a huge part of our lives. I found it quite interesting how the m5go, which was such a tiny looking device, could actually be used to make products such as an alarm clock, a gaming device and many more... ~Haasini Priya 2O 2021

  

As coding was still very new to my group mates and I, we struggled to understand the technical coding terms at first but with the support and guidance of the trainers, we were able to clearly articulate problem statements given to us and brainstorm potential solutions to solve the problem. ~ Pay Xinyi, 2A 2021

  

One challenge I had faced was trying to figure out what was the right code in order to get the microbit to carry out the desired action. This was because we were given the freedom to experiment on our own which also made us use our problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Another challenge I faced was thinking about a solution to make our school better using the microbit. This was due to the fact that even though the microbit is very useful, there are still limitations to it like the range the microbit can pick up senses from which restricts the amount of ways we can use it for the benefit of the school... ~Chloe Tay, 2O 2021

**2021 IP3 Digitalisation for Youths (Mobile App Creation)**

  

Our IP3 Cedarians round off their three eventful days of BCL (Beyond Classroom Learning) programme with a hands-on session to create their very own Mobile Apps. Using Thunkable, a block-based coding web application, students are able to learn about the basic principles behind coding and get their very own mobile apps up and running within the one and a half day session. Besides acquiring a new set of skills beyond the classroom curriculum, this is also when authentic learning takes place. This group of Cedarians will have the opportunity to make good use of what they have learnt to make a positive impact to the Cedar community in their Social Innovation (S.I.) projects.

  

The program really allowed me to put my imagination to the test as I never thought that I would be able to create something based on my imagination so accurately. One of the biggest challenges that I faced was when I had to do coding so that the app would carry out actions that I wanted it to when it is used by a person. The process of coding was very repetitive and confusing but I eventually got the hang of it and was really satisfied with my final product. ~ Thippana Thanmayi 3P 2021

  

From the SI app building workshop, I was able to learn how to develop a real app which could even be published. Contrary to what I thought, I was able to choose the app of my choice to create which was definitely an upside to the programme, making it more interesting and engaging for me...Overall, this programme has benefited me a lot by not only equipping me with the knowledge of how to design an app but also how to use social innovation to solve problems. ~ Kiki Toe, 3P 2021
