### Our Social Innovation Projects

<img src="/images/osip1.png" style="width:50%">

In Cedar, our students are mentored to develop social responsibility and a deeper understanding for the community beyond themselves through our Social Innovation Programme. They are encouraged to critically innovate and refine ideas and solutions to address the social issues identified. The process of developing and implementing their social innovation projects encourages and challenges them cognitively but also at a visceral level. 

  

Our students are guided to develop their personal moral compass rooted in social and moral responsibility. Part of this development involves facilitating opportunities for our students to care for and be compassionate to others who may be different from them. Empathy is the integral foundation of a human-centred design process as one needs to understand the people whom one is designing for. In order to build empathy for common good, the students are consistently challenged and prompted to understand others through observation, engagement during interaction with specific target demographics and immersing themselves in the experiences of the people they are designing solutions for.

  

Students need to possess an open-minded attitude as their original ideas will undergo several iterations of modification after seeking feedback from their target demographics. Through the process of working on these projects, students will also learn to respect the perspectives of others as they work together in teams to build on each others strengths.

Cedar Social Innovation (CSI) is a special event held once every four years, where the whole school  embarks on extended social innovation projects culminating in a day when the projects are executed and celebrated. This year’s event faced several constraints owing to Covid-19. Nevertheless, the school was able to mark our Social Innovation (SI) journey and achievements on 3 July. It was heartening to see how our students displayed perseverance and resilience in completing all their projects. There were many good quality projects and sales pitches that were highly commended by their organisations. 

  

The four levels of classes were assigned different themes to work on: <br>
**Year 1 - Incalculating Olympic Values through sports <br>Year 2 - Tech for Good <br>Year 3 - Intergenerational learning <br>Year 4 - Climate change**



**Year 1 Incalculating Olympic Values through sports**


We find it a pity that we could not interview the preschool teacher and carry out our games with the children. It would have been great if we interview the preschool teachers face to face and look at the way they respond to our questions. However, it was fun during the process for the prototype and brainstorming ideas.

Our project is a three legged race Relay race. There will be 4 stations (with 10 m gap) - hurdles, Cones (run zig-zag), crawling and for the final sprint, three legged race. All students would tie one of their legs together and they need to practice teamwork in order to reach the finishing line first. The winning team will win a goodie bag. To demonstrate the instructions, we have made mini figures of us.
