### Our Social Innovation Projects

<img src="/images/osip1.png" style="width:50%">

In Cedar, our students are mentored to develop social responsibility and a deeper understanding for the community beyond themselves through our Social Innovation Programme. They are encouraged to critically innovate and refine ideas and solutions to address the social issues identified. The process of developing and implementing their social innovation projects encourages and challenges them cognitively but also at a visceral level. 

  

Our students are guided to develop their personal moral compass rooted in social and moral responsibility. Part of this development involves facilitating opportunities for our students to care for and be compassionate to others who may be different from them. Empathy is the integral foundation of a human-centred design process as one needs to understand the people whom one is designing for. In order to build empathy for common good, the students are consistently challenged and prompted to understand others through observation, engagement during interaction with specific target demographics and immersing themselves in the experiences of the people they are designing solutions for.

  

Students need to possess an open-minded attitude as their original ideas will undergo several iterations of modification after seeking feedback from their target demographics. Through the process of working on these projects, students will also learn to respect the perspectives of others as they work together in teams to build on each others strengths.

Cedar Social Innovation (CSI) is a special event held once every four years, where the whole school  embarks on extended social innovation projects culminating in a day when the projects are executed and celebrated. This year’s event faced several constraints owing to Covid-19. Nevertheless, the school was able to mark our Social Innovation (SI) journey and achievements on 3 July. It was heartening to see how our students displayed perseverance and resilience in completing all their projects. There were many good quality projects and sales pitches that were highly commended by their organisations. 

  

The four levels of classes were assigned different themes to work on: <br>
**Year 1 - Incalculating Olympic Values through sports <br>Year 2 - Tech for Good <br>Year 3 - Intergenerational learning <br>Year 4 - Climate change**



**Year 1 Incalculating Olympic Values through sports**


We find it a pity that we could not interview the preschool teacher and carry out our games with the children. It would have been great if we interview the preschool teachers face to face and look at the way they respond to our questions. However, it was fun during the process for the prototype and brainstorming ideas.

Our project is a three legged race Relay race. There will be 4 stations (with 10 m gap) - hurdles, Cones (run zig-zag), crawling and for the final sprint, three legged race. All students would tie one of their legs together and they need to practice teamwork in order to reach the finishing line first. The winning team will win a goodie bag. To demonstrate the instructions, we have made mini figures of us.

#### 2016

On 25th May 2016, Cedar embarked on a day of service, known as the Cedar Social Innovation Day with the theme of Connecting Communities. It was a day where the entire Cedar population was engaged in service activities and volunteerism to support the school’s vision in nurturing social innovators. It turned out to be a fruitful and fulfilling experience for both the students and teachers as they worked together to contribute back to the community.

  

The four levels of classes were assigned different themes to work on (Read on to view the projects and student reflections):

  

Level 1 - Play for Children <br>
Level 2 - Kindness to the Community<br>
Level 3 - Elderly<br>
Level 4 - Anti-Littering Outreach (Story-Telling)

**The Maker's Clinic Workshop (1M)**  

  

Nur Syakirah Bte Osam (Group 7):  
  
We had a blast during the 3 days of The Maker's Clinic workshop and we learnt a lot throughout the sessions. Two of the pictures show our hard work making the prototype from scratch. The other picture is a combination of 3 groups that are going to the same organisation, Nurturing Roots. We were discussing the project at that time. It was definitely an experience making the prototype and doing discussions with my group. We came up with wonderful ideas that we think would capture the interest of the children from the kindergarten!

Dharsika Anathan:CSI thus far has been an enriching experience. It has definitely taught my group mates and I how to be an independent and courteous Cedarian. We have also learnt lifelong skills in the process of making our product. This CSI experience has definitely changed my outlook on life, mainly, on empathy.  Through CSI I have learnt how to empathise. My group mates and I have come up with a product which will instil the value of teamwork in the nursery children we are going to be working with. Our product is an enlarged maze which requires the students to stand around the maze and manoeuvre so as to achieve a common goal: getting the ball to the other end of the maze.

Address: BLK 120 Bukit Merah View #01-04/06 Singapore 152120  
  
**About the organisation:**  <br>
The organsiation provides early childhood programme for children below 6 years old whose developmental and learning needs have been hindered by their social disadvantages. These children would leave the programme ready for primary school and the Centre  serves as a focal point that encourages the value of education as well as a culture of learning among the families of our children and within the neighbourhoods where they live.  
The centre aims to provide a quality environment and a pre-school curriculum that nurtures children’s growth emotionally, socially, cognitively and physically. It is a warm and welcoming place that actively involves parents and care-givers to take an active interest in their children’s education.  
  
Admission is strictly by invitation and based on the challenges faced by the family. Usually these would be children who are developmentally behind and would find it difficult in a large class. These children would benefit from an environment where there is a smaller teacher-student ratio and an Individualised Education Plan.The centre believes that parents are the first educators in their children’s lives. Regardless of their backgrounds, they play key roles in their children’s education and the centre will create opportunities for them to lead, problem solve, make decisions and contribute towards the goals of the school.  
Regular dialogues and activities are conducted to strengthen co-operation between teachers and parents so that children will experience the significant adults in their lives as people who take an active interest in their education and development.  
  
**Stage 1: Interview/Empathy**

<img src="/images/osip16.png" style="width:60%">

In February, together with our Form Teacher, we recced HSC Development Centre & interviewed the Principal, Ms Sua Swee Lee. The student leaders raised the interview questions and overall it was a fruitful session as we got to know the orgnaisation better and it enabled us to better plan the activities more efficiently. We learnt about the problems or challenges faced by organisation/beneficiary of organisation. Org provides pre-sch academic foundation, social & emotional support, inculcate values eg perseverance, due to their socially disadvantaged home background. When they move on to pri sch, they are unlikely to perform as well as mainstream.

**Interview Questions on 16/2 with Principal Ms Sua Swee Lee**  
1\. What are the past activities that have been conducted that the children enjoyed?  
2\. What values do you want our activities to inculcate in the children?  
3\. How well do the children interact with one another?  
4\. Are there any specific children who require special attention?  
5\. What are some special safety precautions you recommend us to take?  
6\. Is photography allowed in the centre when we are carrying out our activities

<img src="/images/osip17.png" style="width:60%">

The Principal of the childcare centre, explaining to the student leaders about the proposed activities and how the class can better cater to the needs of the organisation and direct the activities more towards the children at the childcare.

<img src="/images/osip21.png" style="width:60%">

The student leaders scanned the surroundings and artefacts. This information was then relayed to the rest of the class so that the activities planned are able to meet the organisation’s needs.

Stage 2: (See table below)<br>
Class 2A will embark on different fun and engaging activities demonstrating the theme of Kindness for children aged 2-6. The activities include interactive role play demonstrating acts of kindness, sing and dance, leaf printing/origami craft making, followed by a sharing/reflection.

It is our hope that the children can exhibit acts of kindness in their everyday lives.These activities will benefit the organisation as the children will learn to be kind and pass it on, showing kindness even after the class visit to the organisation.

Prototypes, props and scripts with story line are drawn up. Everyone plays an active role, rehearsing, drafting and prototyping.

Stage 3:<br>
The class is split into groups of five, with each group conducting a different activity at the organisation.

Group 1 @Bay 1 (2 -3 year old)<br>
Group 2 @Bay 2 ( 4-6 year old)

  

The activities are held concurrently, Group 1 manned by 10 students, Group 2 manned by 20 students. Child Care Centre Caregivers & 2 FTs are around to supervise. 2 Student leaders will serve as photographer & reporter. The centre allow us to capture the children in action,and we will in return send photos to the organizer. Sharing of photos are allowed for our school’s internal use.

We are advised not to use the handphone as its distracting for the children. Cedarians will be told to keep handphones between 9.00 – 12.00pm

**Names & Roles of Group Members / Exco**

<img src="/images/osip26.png" style="width:60%">

**CSI with 3M!**

**How did your class conduct the activity?**  <br>
A mass exercise and dance session was organised for the old folks as an ice-breaker activity. Thereafter the class split into 3 groups to set up 3 stations for the old folks. The 3 stations are: 1. Traditional Games like marbles and five stones. 2.Colouring. 3. Origami.

  

**What are the responses from the organization /community that your class is serving?**  <br>
The responses are positive and the old folks enjoyed our company. The participation rate is also higher as compared to the normal routine run by the centre. Some old folks asked when are we returning so that they can see us again, and that what we would be doing when we come back.

  

**How does your class feel about the outcome of their project?**  <br>
We have met the objective of bringing joy to the residents at the home. 

  

**What have the class learnt, collectively?**  <br>
During our reflection, we have learnt that it is our responsibility to take care of our parents and even grandparents. Also we should spend more time with our family members and especially our grandparents. There were some regrets that we did not spend more time with our grandparents when they were still around. It is also important to work together with our friends so that we can carry out our plans effectively. Also, we should always adapt to the situation and make impromptu decisions to solve any unforeseen problems that arise during the execution of our plans. In all, it was a heart-warming and fulfilling activity.
