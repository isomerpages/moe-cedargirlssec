**ABOUT**<br>
The Cedar Infocomm Club (CIC) aims to develop computational thinking in our members. Our modular structure enables our members to gain knowledge and concepts, and in teams they explore problem solving techniques and logic reasoning using computing to solve problems in authentic situations.

  

As part of the nation's effort to build a digital hub that is globally competitive, we endeavour for our students to be empowered to pursue their passion in the field of technology. Besides CCA sessions, our members go on learning journeys, IMDA workshops and competitions to broaden their knowledge and further hone their skills.
