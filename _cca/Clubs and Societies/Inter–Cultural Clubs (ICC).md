**About**<br>
The Inter-Cultural Club (ICC) is a new CCA for 2023 that focuses on the appreciation and promotion of intercultural diversity and ethnicity among the school community.  ICC will expose students to different cultures, especially local and ASEAN cultures, and heighten their cultural quotient. They will also support in championing and enhancing the school’s cultural awareness (e.g., support the organisation of key festival celebrations, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day).
