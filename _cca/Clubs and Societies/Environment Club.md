<p><strong>ABOUT</strong>
<br>The Cedar Environment Club was established in 2011. Its vision is for
every Cedarian to be an Environment Champion by empowering students to
take the initiative to protect the environment. As a club, we often carry
out upcycling during our CCA sessions and go on learning journeys. The
insights gained during the learning journeys often inspire change in the
school’s environmental measures. The club also manages large-scale recycling
in school-wide events and weekly recycling programmes. Over the years,
students participate in environment-related competitions and workshops,
so as to nurture social innovators who inspire positive change in the protection
of the environment.</p>
