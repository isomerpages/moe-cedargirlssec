### Environment Club

<img src="/images/cs3.png" style="width:60%">

**ABOUT**  
The Cedar Environment Club was established in 2011. Its vision is for every Cedarian to be an Environment Champion by empowering students to take the initiative to protect the environment. As a club, we often carry out upcycling during our CCA sessions and go on learning journeys. The insights gained during the learning journeys often inspire change in the school’s environmental measures. The club also manages large-scale recycling in school-wide events and weekly recycling programmes. Over the years, students participate in environment-related competitions and workshops, so as to nurture social innovators who inspire positive change in the protection of the environment.
