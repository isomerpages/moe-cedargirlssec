##### **ABOUT**<br>
ELDDS (Drama) seeks to develop students as performers, playwrights, directors and theatre practitioners. The programmes nurture a love for the performing arts and develop our members in the areas of performance, speech, improvisation and stage management. Through rigorous training sessions, students are prepared for various youth performances, such as the SYF Arts Presentation. They achieved the Certificate of Distinction in both 2021 and 2023. Members are also given the opportunity to explore enrichment courses conducted by professional trainers from How Drama. They have explored playback theatre, mask-work, shadow puppetry and most recently, commedia dell'arte. They have performed at public platforms such as the Concourse at the Esplanade this year for #tellstory. Their passion for the arts has also been shared with the wider community. They performed at St John's Home in 2023 and the Society of Sheng Hong Welfare services in 2022.
