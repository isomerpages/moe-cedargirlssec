### Overview

Uniformed Groups CCAs provide students with authentic and rigorous learning experiences which will help them develop and exemplify lifelong qualities in communication, collaboration and leadership. Through a strong teamwork and leadership-driven culture, our Uniformed Groups make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, self-discipline and a spirit of service to others.
