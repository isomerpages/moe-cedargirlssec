### National Cadet Corps (NCC)

**ABOUT**  <br>
The Cedar National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims to develop a strong sense of responsibility, resilience and resourcefulness in the cadets, so as to nurture successful young citizens. Through weekly parades and NCC activities, the cadets are groomed into leaders of character who strive to do their best. The cadets are exposed to numerous military-related activities like stimulated firing, live range shooting and obstacle courses. This enables them to appreciate the importance of our nation’s military defence.

  

The NCC cadets also learn the importance of teamwork, through the Freestyle Drill (FSD), which incorporates fun into foot drills. Senior Cadets also have the opportunity to participate in the Orienteering Competition, which hones their map skills and problem-solving skills, as they face numerous adversaries in a foreign environment. The strong camaraderie forged with their platoon mates during the NCC Journey will truly enrich the lives of the cadets in the Cedar NCC.
