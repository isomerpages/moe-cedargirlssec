<p><strong>ABOUT</strong> 
<br>The Cedar National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims to develop a strong sense of
responsibility, resilience and resourcefulness in the cadets, so as to
nurture successful young citizens. Through weekly parades and NCC activities,
the cadets are groomed into leaders of character who strive to do their
best. The cadets are exposed to numerous military-related activities like
stimulated firing, live range shooting and obstacle courses. This enables
them to appreciate the importance of our nation’s military defence.</p>
<p>The NCC cadets also learn the importance of teamwork, through the Freestyle
Drill (FSD), which incorporates fun into foot drills. Senior Cadets also
have the opportunity to participate in the Orienteering Competition, which
hones their map skills and problem-solving skills, as they face numerous
adversaries in a foreign environment. The strong camaraderie forged with
their platoon mates during the NCC Journey will truly enrich the lives
of the cadets in the Cedar NCC.</p>
