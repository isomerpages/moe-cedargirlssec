<p><strong>ABOUT</strong> 
<br>Cedar Red Cross Youth (RCY) aims to develop a strong sense of social responsibility
and discipline in its cadets through enriching activities which promote
teamwork, emergency responsiveness, community involvement and leadership
skills. Cadets are exposed to a diverse range of useful skills and knowledge
through the Red Cross Youth subjects:</p>

They participate in a variety of school and HQ activities, such as the
March Leadership Camp, the Unit Specialist’s Programme, the Warrant Officer’s
Programme, Red Cross Youth Challenge and more.</p>

<p>To build on their skills and confidence, cadets also participate in a
variety of competitions such as the First Aid Competition, Ambassadors
of Blood Donation Competition, Disaster Risk Reduction Championship, and
the Trailblazers Championship. They also get the opportunity to participate
in the National Day Parade and as part of the Cedar National Day contingent,
which cultivate a sense of pride to their school and nation.</p>
<p>With the principles of the Red Cross Movement rooted in our hearts and
minds, RCY cadets stand by the belief that Humanity is in Our Hands, as
that every cadet has a part to play as a part of a larger international
humanitarian network. Cedar Red Cross Youth will continue to serve with
compassion.</p>
