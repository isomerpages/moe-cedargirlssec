<h5><strong>ABOUT</strong></h5>
<p>ELDDS (Drama) seeks to develop students as performers, playwrights, directors
and theatre practitioners. The programmes nurture a love for the performing
arts and develop our members in the areas of performance, speech, improvisation
and stage management. Through rigorous training sessions, students are
prepared for various youth performances, such as the SYF Arts Presentation.
They achieved the Certificate of Distinction in both 2021 and 2023. Members
are also given the opportunity to explore enrichment courses conducted
by professional trainers from How Drama. They have explored playback theatre,
mask-work, shadow puppetry and most recently, commedia dell'arte. They
have performed at public platforms such as the Concourse at the Esplanade
this year for #tellstory. Their passion for the arts has also been shared
with the wider community. They performed at St John's Home in 2023 and
the Society of Sheng Hong Welfare services in 2022.</p>
