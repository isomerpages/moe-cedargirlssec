### Overview

Performing Arts CCAs provide opportunities for students to develop their knowledge and skills to pursue a lifelong passion for the arts. Our Performing Arts groups nurture studentsâ€™ creative expression, enrich social, cultural and historical awareness, and build their exemplary character. While each of the Performing Arts CCA is distinctive and comprises its own set of knowledge, skills and attitudes, they also aim to instil in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.
