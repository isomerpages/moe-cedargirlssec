**ABOUT**  <br>
With the aim to develop confident, committed and values driven singers, the Cedar Girls’ Choir has distinguished itself as a Distinction Award choir in the biennial SYF over the years. Under the baton of Choral Director, Ms Naomi Chye, the choir also brings honour to the nation by garnering Gold awards at International choral competitions including Pacific Basin Music Festival, Hawaii and Festival of Songs Olomouc, Czech Republic. In the local arena, our choir emerged Champion in the National Schools XinYao新谣 Singing Competition and emerged Top 3 in the Finals of the Sing A Nation Mediacorp TV Contest. 

The choir has also been invited to perform at The President's Star Charity Show; The National Gallery, the National Museum; The Esplanade Limelight series; The World Conference of The Bloomberg Awards Ceremony; The Asia Pacific Symposium for Music Education, The Singapore Embassy in Seoul as well as the official recording choir for NDP. 

  

From Classical works to popular and Broadway jazz, our avid singers explore music from cultural and historical perspectives while singing in harmony. To spread the joy of community singing, our Values in Action initiatives involved performing & interacting with the Potong Pasir residents; the St John’s Home; the St Luke’s Hospital, and the MusicFest @ The Singapore General Hospital.   All these platforms have enabled the choir, as singing ambassadors, to foster goodwill and partnership with our community. This year to celebrate Cedar 65th anniversary, the choir recorded the school song with a new orchestral arrangement. After singing virtually for 2 years, with the easing of SMM, the choir is looking forward to more Live performances.
