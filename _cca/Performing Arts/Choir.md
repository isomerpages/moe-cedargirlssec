<p><strong>ABOUT</strong> 
<br>With the aim to develop confident, committed and values-driven singers,
the Cedar Choir, under the baton of choral director, Ms Naomi Chye, has
distinguished itself as a Distinction Award choir in the biennial Singapore
Youth Festival over the years. Ranging from classical to popular music,
alongside local and xinyao songs, the choir’s repertoire embraces cultural
diversity and evokes joy, hope, ambition, unity and the pursuit of a better
future.</p>
<p>In 2023, the choir has proven that they are able to attain pre-pandemic
levels of singing by clinching Certificate of Distinction at the SYF. Besides
participating in school wide performances, to foster goodwill and partnership
with our community, our values in action involved interacting with the
residents at nursing homes, hospitals &amp; eldercare organisations. This
year, besides participating in the Cedar Arts Fest, the choir also performed
at the Esplanade Concourse concert series, ‘In Youthful Company’. Overall,
the increased live performances and the opportunity for the choir to engage
in planning the repertoire and music arrangement, has nurtured confidence
and self expression.</p>
