### Handbell Ensemble


![](/images/handbell2023.jpg)
**ABOUT**  <br>
Cedar Handbell Ensemble (CHE) was established in 2000, being one of the eight privileged schools to own handbells and handchimes. As of 2022, the Ensemble consists of 54 ringers, from Year One to Four.

In 2011, Cedar Girls’ Secondary School were the only school to be awarded the coveted Gold with Honours in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging. Since then, we have been receiving many compliments and opportunities to perform and showcase our
works. Under the tutelage of Mr Damien Lim, a very prominent figure in Singapore and international handbell industry, our handbell team continues to grow from strength to strength.

Over the years, CHE had the honour to collaborate and learn from many professionals in the music scene, including RingTouch from Hong Kong, Ministry of Bellz from Singapore, and famous conductors such as Miss Emily Li from Hong Kong, Mr Malcolm Wilson from Scotland and Mr Toshikazu Yoshida, a world-renowned conductor, from Japan. These professionals have benefitted our ringers with their invaluable insights and advice.

In 2014, CHE was given the opportunity to showcase our skills through the Community Chest Care &amp; Share SG50 Light up Ceremony (Christmas light up by H.E President Tony Tan). In 2015, we had the privilege and honour to perform for both the 16th ASEAN Culture and Information (COCI) Sub-Committee for Culture (SCC) meetings and the
Peranakan Arts Festival. CHE was honoured to be chosen to perform for the MTV of the SYF 2017 Virtual Music Clip. In 2018, CHE had performed in the MOB concert and Nexilius concert in support of the Singapore’s Association for the deaf. Our continued partnership with MOB for the&nbsp;Extra•Ordinary&nbsp;People concert in 2019 and 2023 provided another
platform for us to perform with students from Special Education (SPED) schools. Through this process, we seek to build on the foundation for a more inclusive society. These valuable experiences not only help us develop critical skills and broaden our horizons, but also boost our
team’s confidence for public performance.
