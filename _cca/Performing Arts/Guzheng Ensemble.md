<p><strong>ABOUT</strong> 
<br>The Cedar Guzheng Ensemble strives to inculcate a deep artistic appreciation
for the 2500-year-old traditional Chinese instrument as well as its History
since ancient China. We value teamwork, unity, discipline and commitment,
encouraging every member to work together, forge friendships and gain skills
that will last a lifetime. As we continue to create music as a team, we
hope to move hearts and inspire many others to learn more about this ancestral
instrument.</p>
<p>The Cedar Guzheng Ensemble has attained many remarkable achievements through
the years, such as the Certificate of Distinction/Accomplishment at the
Singapore Youth Festival for the past few years.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of our instructors as well as the continuous support
of our teachers-In-charge, the members of the Cedar Guzheng Ensemble will
continue to do their best and strive for greater heights.</p>
