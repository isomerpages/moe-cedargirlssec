**ABOUT**  <br>
The Cedar Guzheng Ensemble strives to inculcate a deep artistic appreciation for the 2500-year-old traditional Chinese instrument as well as its History since ancient China. We value teamwork, unity, discipline and commitment, encouraging every member to work together, forge friendships and gain skills that will last a lifetime. As we continue to create music as a team, we hope to move hearts and inspire many others to learn more about this ancestral instrument.

  

The Cedar Guzheng Ensemble has attained many remarkable achievements through the years, such as the Certificate of Distinction/Accomplishment at the Singapore Youth Festival for the past few years. 
  

Under the guidance of our instructors as well as the continuous support of our teachers-In-charge, the members of the Cedar Guzheng Ensemble will continue to do their best and strive for greater heights.
