**ABOUT**  
With valour, comradeship, discipline and pride, the Cedar Basketball Team strives for a common purpose in the spirit of togetherness. Through active participation and group involvement, we aim to exercise sportsmanship by playing by the rules, respecting our opponents and the game officials, and representing the school and CCA with confidence and pride. At Cedar, we aspire to instil discipline in oneself and foster team bonding and friendships that will last for a lifetime.
