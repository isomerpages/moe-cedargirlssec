### Overview

Physical Sports CCAs develop resilience, fair play and team spirit in students. Building on the schoolâ€™s PE curriculum that develops their broad-based physical competencies for recreational participation, students in sports CCAs train rigorously, collaboratively, and competitively to strengthen their sports knowledge and skills to compete, e.g., in the National School Games and other comparable sporting competitions. Through a four-year endeavour as a student-athlete, students develop stronger resilience and determination as well as a zeal for excellence and the moral values for life.
