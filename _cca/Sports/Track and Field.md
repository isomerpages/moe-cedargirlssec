<p><strong>ABOUT</strong>
<br>Track and Field is a niche CCA of Cedar Girls’ Secondary School. Since
1968, we have clinched&nbsp; more than 40 B and C Division championships
in the National Inter-School Track and Field Championships. Today, there
are close to 100 members in the team. Our CCA comprises of several events
such as cross-country, sprints, jumps, throws, long-distance, pole vault
and race walk. The training sessions are held 3 times a week, with sessions
running throughout the year, including during part of the school holidays.
Through these rigorous training sessions, our athletes have achieved huge
success in competitions like the SAA Series and the National Schools Track
and Field Meet. Some of our athletes even represented the nation in overseas
competitions such as ASEAN Schools Games and&nbsp;LAWA (Little Athletics
Western Australia).&nbsp;</p>
